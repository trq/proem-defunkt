The start of a small, simple, PHP MVC.


The main objective here is to create a small, simple, fast PHP MVC framework. I am convinced
with the idea of designing an application object around the idea of the filter chain pattern.

A request comes in which initiates the chain, filters the request data while building all of
the resources required to respond. The response is then filtered and built back out through
the chain and off to the client. Simple, in theory.

After attending an awesome SCRUM presentation a few months back and then backing that up more
recently with another on TDD I am also determined to go about this project in a very `Agile`
fashion.
